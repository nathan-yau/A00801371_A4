## Scenario

Welcome to the world of Oasis of the Lost Adventure, an adventure game that will take you on a journey through a 
mystical land. In this game, you will play the role of an adventurer 
who is driven by a burning desire to uncover the mysteries of the lost city's Sanctum.

## Goal

In this game, your goal is to enter the Sanctum and defeat the final boss that guards the Sanctum.

## How to Play


### Movement: 

Use keyword (A, W, S, D) or click buttons on GUI to move your character around the 5x5 game board. 

A - Move Left | D - Move Right

W - Move Up | S - Move Down

You will encounter different obstacles and enemies on your way to the Sanctum.

### Searching: 

Look out for hidden treasures along the way. 

Use the search button to explore the surrounding areas and discover items that can help you on your journey.

### Combat: 

When you encounter an enemy, use your "physical attack" and "magic attack" buttons to defeat them. 

Some enemies will be immune to physical attacks, while others will be immune to magic attacks.


### Potions:

You can use different types of potions to heal yourself or increase your attributes:
- Healing Potion: Restores 50 health points. 
- Status Potion: Restores your status back to healthy. 
- Attribute Potion: Randomly increases one of your attributes by 5 to 20 points.

## Attributes:
Your character has five attributes: 
- "Strength", "Dexterity", "Intelligence", "Magic Power", "Magic Resistance", and "Intelligence". 

These attributes determine your character's combat skills, maximum HP and maximum MP to navigate through obstacles.

You can increase your attributes by using attribute potions or leveling up.

### Leveling up:

You will gain experience points (EXP) for defeating enemies.

As you accumulate EXP, you will level up, which will increase your attributes and restore your status to full health.

### Quests: 

Along the way, you will encounter a NPC who will offer you quests to complete. 

This quest will reward you with a valuable item.
